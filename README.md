# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to find out if the number of bike stations within different parts of Quebec City correlates with the number of businesses within that location

1.	Define the problem
2.	Extraction of data from city-bike API
3.	Extraction of data from Foursquare and Yelp API
4.	Cleaned the data 
5.	Extracted relevant data from all three datasets and joined them into a single data frame 
6.	Performed EDA on the new dataset 


## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges
