# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to find out if the number of bike stations within different parts of Quebec City correlates with the number of businesses within that location

1.	Define the problem
2.	Extraction of data from city-bike API
3.	Extraction of data from Foursquare and Yelp API
4.	Cleaned the data 
5.	Extracted relevant data from all three datasets and joined them into a single data frame 
6.	Performed EDA on the new dataset 


## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
My major challenge whilst working on this project was extraction of data from both Yelp and Foursquare API. I ran into LIMIT based on the amount of API request I can make within a period time which significantly slowed my progress.

I also faced some time constraint challenges which prevented me from exploring those dataset in dept as Iâ€™d preferred to. 


## Future Goals
My future goal for this project will be to explore other city and also find out if certain time of the day affect bikes availability and what could have triggered the change if any.
